As my blog title says, this is my blog- and I'm Nikki Bee! As the footer says, I'm currently doing an internship for [Outreachy](https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/),  which is the December 2015 to March 2016 round. For now I'll be only using this every one or two weeks to talk about my internship. When/if I have more use for it in the future, I'll update this section accordingly!

I made this blog site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/), which are both pretty nifty!
